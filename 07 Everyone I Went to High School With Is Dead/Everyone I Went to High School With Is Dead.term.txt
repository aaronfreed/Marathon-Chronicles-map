You’re at Pine View School for the Gifted in Sarasota, Florida.  Evidently, the Pfhor  wanted to rid humanity of its best and brightest minds of the future. However, their research must not have been particularly thorough, because they’ve taken the liberty of attacking it on a school holiday.

I have yet to determine what strategic interest they think attacking Pine View serves.  Perhaps they believe attacking Bernhard’s old high school will help them avenge Battle Group Seven.
#PICT 1604


At any rate, their invasion has been uncharacteristically coordinated, and they appear to be using Pine View as their base of communications on Earth. I think you’ve known me long enough to know what I want you to do.

By the way, I’ll be sending some of my S’pht in to help with the fighting.  They’re coloured differently from the enslaved S’pht (blue and green, specifically), so you should be able to tell them apart. I know it’s your idiom to attack everything that moves, but please refrain from attacking them.

I’ll contact you again when you’ve found this school’s computer lab. Good luck.

August 23 was when they said it would definatly be out.  So that's... 90 days since the Marathon crisis started.  On the end of the month we should pray, since it'll be 100 days since the crisis began.

August 23 was when they said it would definatly be out.  So that's... 90 days since the Marathon crisis started.  On the end of the month we should pray, since it'll be 100 days since the crisis began.

Just got off the phone with Jason, lead programmer at Bungie. Tomorrow
night the demo will be posted on AOL, eWorld, CompuServe, and of course,
the Internet.

Please don't e-mail me, I don't have it.

Hahahaha.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  Tell Jason and Doug that I don't believe them.  Too much 'wolf', not enough herding.  :)

The Pfhor have shut me out of their network and I cannot find the next switch.

Thankfully, $Byou$b can.

No, you don’t understand.  You $Bcan$b.

Have fun.

$C3ydnar: hamish: can you identify the plant in infinity's final screen?
Godot: plant?
ydnar: yeah
Godot: Randy: you mean the bamboo pen?
ydnar: it's not bamboo. that's a cross section sketch of a stem
Godot: looks like a bamboo no mistaking it
ydnar: nope. want to know?
Godot: the far right one is the tip of a Japanese writing brush/pen
ydnar: <g> they're all sketches of one particular plant
Godot: ok what's the planet? 
ydnar: earth :-)
Godot: err, plant
ydnar: magnolia :)
Godot: gimme a break
ydnar: ::raising eyebrow::
Godot: what's the third drawing? before the arm
ydnar: hmm.. don't have the picture up what's it look like
Godot: the tip of a Japanese writing brush/pen has a bamboo like notch
Godot: the hairs are tied together in the form of a brush
Godot: that's what it looks like to me
ydnar: ah, the base of the magnolia bud
Godot: the stem looks just like a bamboo stem IMHO
ydnar: ::nod:: it's similar
Godot: if you slice it, it would look exactly like that
Godot: so what's the significance of the magnolia?
ydnar: birth. what's the first picture?
Godot: looked like creation to me. magnolia = birth?
ydnar: the seed: it progresses from seed to stem to flower
Godot: why does magnolia signify birth? (not into flowers much)
ydnar: that's all i'm going to say... :)
ydnar: hehe it's hardly a flower. that particular one was 30 feet high
