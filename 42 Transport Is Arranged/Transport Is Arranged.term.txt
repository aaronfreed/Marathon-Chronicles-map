$C3The S’pht have preserved a myth, throughout their long period of slavery, about a lost S’pht clan that abandoned Lh’owon before the Pfhor invaded. The ten clans that stayed were destroyed or disbanded after the invasion, the survivors scattered as slaves throughout the Pfhor empire.

If this mythical eleventh clan survived, it has had a millennium to grow and learn since leaving Lh’owon. My S’pht believe there is a way to contact them somewhere on Lh’owon, and that is what we are searching for.

The S’pht rebellion against Pfhor tyranny will surely fail unless we locate the lost clan.

Explore the area and return here.$C0

$C3The Pfhor have been on Lh’owon for nearly fifteen years, awaiting our arrival. But amusingly enough, morale in their garrison here is terrible. The Pfhor have been sending their worst officers to Lh’owon as punishment for nearly nine years – they clearly have no idea of this world’s importance.

I need you to explore the ancient S’pht Citadel of Antiquity. Perhaps we’ll learn something there. The Pfhor obviously know absolutely nothing of the Eleventh Clan, so you’ll have to dive into your archaeology headfirst. Unfortunately, I’m not sure how you’ll access it, since the S’pht barricaded it off in their eleventh hour before enslavement. But life was made for trying.$C0

$C5I felt S’bhuth at burning dawn. 

The endless war rages about us, and yet we, the S’pht’Kr, cannot fight. S’bhuth stops us. 

He bled on me, straining. He says to not let more S’pht feel him.  

He says more will destroy him, that he was meant not to be alone.$C0

$C5We leave this message for any who might find it, but we have barricaded off this area, to make it difficult.  

S’bhuth has gone into a deep trance; we know we’ll soon be leaving Lh’owon, but we don’t know how. The border fighting has ceased; the other clans know something is going on, but can’t see the grass for the fires.

We have sent emissaries to the other clans, but only S’bhuth knows what messages they carry.$C0

$C5We are leaving behind many F’lickta to keep the ducts clean and working. They should be able to build one of their stable societies here — there is plenty of food.  

We would ask that if another clan comes here, they would respect these creatures and leave them to continue their work and preserve our home on Lh’owon.$C0

The S’pht’Mnr attacked us.  

S’bhuth is entranced, and we are powerless to fight back.  

The outer villages have been slaughtered without their defenders. The attackers have overrun and killed most of us who were in the compound.$C0

$C6ZONE 29-s$C2 [Lh’owon Garrison]

We’ve been studying these beasts for some time, but periodically we’ve been forced to kill our specimens and capture new ones because they become unpredictably upset at our presence. It has been difficult to study them for any length of time, but their numbers in the surrounding caves are impressive. The caves must go deeper than we have been able to ascertain.

Our scientific studies have revealed that these creatures are genetic ancestors of the S’pht, although in morphological terms this is absurd.

Also, they don’t eat. They take energy from the sludge that surrounds them, using a method of energy transfer that is unknown to us and beyond our depth of study.

Variations of these creatures live in the active volcanic regions of Lh’owon and there have been two sightings deep in the Central Garrison’s geothermal station. In no cases were the creatures aggressive like they are here.$C0

We have explored many of the surrounding caves, but continually find the combative creatures the S’pht call F’lickta. Archaeological evidence suggests that this was once a center of S’pht life, though it appears to have been abandoned after an ancient battle. 

The quality of the machinery is quite extraordinary, and most of the computer terminals remain functional even after two millennia.$C0

This terminal is teleport—linked to others we installed in caves that are not easily accessible. We also found some additional tunnels by blasting away barricades that were apparently erected during the ancient battle.
