Split map files for an in-development Marathon Aleph One scenario

This is where I’m keeping the latest version of the unmerged map for *Marathon Chronicles*, a scenario I’m building for Marathon Aleph One. It is a sequel to Bungie’s original *Marathon* trilogy, and it is also additionally intended to flow in the same continuity as several other fan sequels to the original game, most directly *Tempus Irae* and *Rubicon*, but also *Phoenix* and *Eternal*. It incorporates artwork and, in some cases, architecture from *Tempus Irae*, *Evil*, and *Rubicon*, as well as the original trilogy, though most maps are largely original.

While I hoarded all this content to myself for, in some cases, some twenty-one years, I now intend for the development process of this scenario, like Aleph One itself, to be largely open-source. As a result, anyone who is interested in contributing to or improving the project is welcome to make their own pull requests or simply send their creations to me directly; if I like them, they will be incorporated into the completed game and you will receive credit.

· You will need Atque to merge this map: https://sourceforge.net/projects/igniferroque/

The map included in the penultimate link is often out of date; you can make your own build of the map files here by merging this folder in Atque. I intend to create a more permanent repository for the game files somewhere else at some point, but I have not done so yet. It will not be practical for me to keep uploading the latest merged map file every time I make a small change, so you will need to merge it yourself if you want the most recent version.

This project is in a very unfinished state; many game terminals are blank, and there are plenty of glitches, inconsistencies, untextured or misaligned walls, and various other issues to be expected in an in-development game. The story is nowhere near complete, and I expect the final version of the game will contain at least ten additional levels that have not yet been constructed. It should at least be possible to play through and win the entire scenario, however, including the bonus levels, unless I’ve introduced some catastrophic, game-breaking bug since the last time I played through the whole thing from start to end. (A few levels may not yet be weaved into the game’s continuity – “Cel din urmă vis” and “Letter to the Night” as of October 1st, but I can’t promise to remember to update this caveat going forward. Additionally, if you play more than fifteen levels straight through without dying, the current version of Aleph One will freeze. This will hopefully be fixed in version 1.3, though I haven’t tested it in beta 1 yet.)

I haven’t yet compiled a complete list of credits for this scenario. I’m responsible for the bulk of the original level design; a few other high school friends, who are credited in the scenario images file (click on the Marathon logo when you open the scenario), co-designed a few levels (specifically “Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt”, “Everyone I Went to High School With Is Dead”, “Delusions of Adequacy…”, and the hidden level “Sweet Silence”, plus “Witty Title Not Included” and “War!” from the net map). I haven’t mentioned them by name because I don’t know if they want their names showing up in search engine results in association with this scenario. If you’re really curious who designed what level, almost all levels have credits in the map writing, hopefully including every level co-designed by others, at least in the solo scenario.

That caveat aside, I will specifically name **Scott Lee** (R.I.P., 1983-2018), to whom I wish to dedicate this scenario; he named it and is responsible for the bulk of the central segment of “Take the Veil”. Additional artwork and story ideas have been contributed by Pfhorums member **General-RADIX**, and she and **Dr John Sumner** have play-tested; other play-testers, many, many years ago, included Fool’s Gold forum members **Roger Mexico**, **Dan Electro**, **DaigotheKing**, and probably others I’ve forgotten.

Other levels are partially adapted from Bungie or Doubleaught levels. I’m not sure this is a complete list of credits, but between these and my net maps, I’ve incorporated levels designed by:  
• **Randy Reddig**:  
    · “Ne cede malis” for “Biblical Candy Machines”,  
    · “Aye Mak Sicur” for “Eon Blue Apocalypse” and “Pfhactory N’Utopia”,  
    · co-design of “Poor Yorick” for part of “Notes on a Criminal Conspiracy”,  
    · “A Converted Church in Venice, Italy” for both “Death in Venice” and “A Converted Net Map in Venice, Italy”,  
    · “You Think You’re Big Time? You’re Gonna Die Big Time!” for “Life Is Wasted on the Living”;  
• **Greg Kirkpatrick**:  
    · co-design of “Poor Yorick” for part of “Notes on a Criminal Conspiracy”,  
    · “Confound Delivery” for most other parts of “Notes on a Criminal Conspiracy”,  
    · co-design of “Son of Grendel” for “How to Disappear Completely”,  
    · “Hang Brain” for part of “Kill Your Sons”,  
    · “Acme Station (Michael Bay Remix)” and “Starless and Bible Black”,  
    · “Charon Doesn’t Make Change” for “Transport Is Arranged”;  
• **Chris Geisel**:  
    · co-design of “Poor Yorick” for part of “Notes on a Criminal Conspiracy”,  
    · co-design of “Son of Grendel” for “How to Disappear Completely”;  
• **Jason Jones**:  
    · “Begging for Mercy Makes Me Angry!” for part of “Kill Your Sons”,  
    · “The Slings & Arrows of Outrageous Fortune” for “Thanatos, Beneath the Dust”,  
    · “Kill Your Television” for “Ys”,  
    · “Sorry Don’t Make It So” and “Pfhor Your Eyes Only” for parts of “Dimensional Bleedthrough”;  
as well as a few other recurring elements from multiple levels designed by multiple creators (most notably, Thoth’s computer banks make an appearance in “Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt”).

I’ve also incorporated occasional geometry from others’ scenarios for network maps and, in one case, a solo level:  
• **James Hastings-Trew**’s designs from *Tempus Irae*:  
    · “The Gates of Delirium” for “Slaughtergarden Suite”,  
    · “Downward Spiral” for “Cathedral of Hate”,  
    · “Brain Damage” for “Lunatic Fringe”; and  
• **Chris Lund**’s for *Rubicon*:  
    · “Not *this* again…” – both versions – for parts of “Dimensional Bleedthrough”,  
    · the original *Rozinante* design for “Cygnus X-1”,  
    · “Breathing Nothing at All”/“Canned Air” for “Fracture”.

Finally, **RyokoTK** has kindly given me permission to adapt his level “Monument to All Your Sins” (aka “The Monolith”, a level in his superb net pack *Starlight*) for solo combat. An embryonic form currently appears as “In the Shadow of Our Pale Companion”; I’m only about 33⅓% finished with item/monster placement, and I may still change the mission somewhat.

Beyond that, of course, there are levels I’ve simply ripped off, more or less remaking them in my own image. Credit to **RyokoTK** for “Roquefortress”, which I shamelessly ripped off for “To Make an Idol of Our Fear and Call It God”, and **James Hastings-Trew** for “Gates of Delirium”, which I shamelessly ripped off for “The Black Angel’s Death Song”. “Black Angel” may actually reuse a couple of architectural elements of “Gates” outright with only small cosmetic changes to lighting; for that matter, a couple of segments of “Miranda, That Ghost Just Isn’t Holy Anymore” are also fairly similar, though in this case the geometry isn’t 100% identical.

Artwork is trickier. Obviously most of the original assets were Bungie’s; credits should be visible in the scenario already when you click the Marathon logo. The HD versions of the *Infinity* textures that appear in *Chronicles* are mostly **Goran Svensson**’s creations based on the original textures. The bump maps in *Infinity*’s Water and Lava sets are Svensson’s creations; the others are, with a small number of exceptions, my own, crude creations which will eventually be replaced with better ones. The HD versions of the *Marathon 2* textures are from Bungie’s own XBLA release of the game; the remakes were made by a team of graphics artists for the now-defunct company Freeverse. The complete list is included in a .pdf with the scenario. Again, the bump maps are my own crude creations and will eventually be replaced with proper ones. A handful of *Marathon 1* textures appear in HD versions that were created by **Tim Vogel**. He also created the tower landscape that appears in a handful of levels, using one of **Craig Mullins**’ chapter screens for *Infinity* as a basis.

I’ve also incorporated graphics from others’ scenarios. The *Tempus Irae* textures and scenery, probably 80% of which appear in *Chronicles*, were mostly designed by **James Hastings-Trew**, apart from the ones adapted outright from Renaissance or Classical artists (mostly **Leonardo da Vinci** and **Michelangelo Buonarroti**, but occasional others as well). **Chris Boroweic** and **Dan Clancy** are also credited for additional artwork in *Tempus Irae*. The bump maps for the *Tempus* textures are, again, my crude, temporary creations.

There are also elements from *Evil* (the staff, the assault rifle, the Devlins, the Cydrones, a few textures, possibly a few other assets I’ve forgotten). **Randall “FrigidMan” Shaw** was the project director of *Evil*, and he is also listed in the artwork credits alongside **Chuck Fox**, **Jesse Freeman**, **James Head**, **Colin James**, and **Randy Reddig**.

I’ve also used plenty of assets from *Rubicon* (several monsters, the fusion rifle, the redesigned Magnum, the redesigned rocket launcher, and several textures in the Earth and Pfhor sets). **Chris Lund** and **D. Scott Brown** were responsible for the bulk of *Rubicon*, including artwork, with credits to **Grant Struthers**, **Jay Faircloth**, **Stefan Stadlberger**, and **Mayang’s free texture library** for additional artwork. Yet again, the bump maps for *Rubicon* textures are my own crude, temporary versions.

I don’t believe I’ve taken much artwork from any other scenario, though it’s possible that a scattered texture or two from *Pfh’Joueur* appears; that scenario, artwork included, was created largely by **Candace “Shebob” Sherriff** (RIP), who credited **Rainier Udelhoven** and **Stephan Bondier** for additional artwork. I also used a couple of textures from **James Hastings-Trew**’s *Megiddo Game*, but probably no more than three. I’ve created a small amount of original artwork myself, but although I’m fairly skilled with Photoshop, my artistic skills are rudimentary at best.

I’ve also used sounds from other scenarios, again mostly *Evil*, *Tempus Irae*, and *Rubicon*. *Rubicon* credits **Chris Lund** for the bulk of the sound (**Elohymn Vilaven** is credited for the title music and *Ascension* theme, which, to my knowledge, I didn’t use, but I wish to make these credits as complete as possible). *Tempus Irae* credits **James Hastings-Trew**, **Chris Boroweic**, **Beth Boroweic**, and **Kain Osterholt** for sounds (plus **Shawn Magee** and **Rich Wilcox** for music, which, again, I doubt I used). *Evil* credits **Johnny Biebesheiemer** and **Randall Shaw** for sounds (plus **Mark McWilliams** for music; yet again, I probably didn’t use this). A few sounds from *Pfh’Joueur* are also included; again, **Candace Sherriff** created the majority of these.

Most level titles are taken from songs or albums, with a few others from books or television. Only a handful don’t come from musical or literary sources. For inspiration, credit to (*deep breath*):

  · **Tears for Fears** (“Sketches of Pain”, “Famous Last Words”; note that the former of these is a pun on the title of **Miles Davis and Gil Evans**’ album *Sketches of Spain*, and I intend my level title as a reference to both);  
  · **the Mars Volta** (“Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt”, “Miranda, That Ghost Just Isn’t Holy Anymore”);  
  · **Gorguts** (“Pleiades’ Dust” and “Sweet Silence”, though the latter doubles as a reference to **Metallica**’s studio in Copenhagen, which for that matter may have been the inspiration for Gorguts’ song title);  
  · **Weakling** (“Cut Their Grain and Place Fire Therein”);  
  · **Panopticon** (“Revisions of the Past”, “To Make an Idol of Our Fear and Call It God”);  
  · **Kurt Vonnegut** (“Slaughterhouse-Five” and its lesser-numbered siblings);  
  · **Television** (“The Dream’s Dream”);  
  · **Mr. Bungle** (“Everyone I Went to High School With Is Dead”);  
  · **Peter Gabriel** (“Here Comes the Flood”);  
  · **the Velvet Underground** (“The Black Angel’s Death Song”);  
  · **Genesis** (“Entangled”, “Supper’s Ready”);  
  · **Karl Popper** (“The Paradox of Tolerance”, first described in ***The Open Society and Its Enemies***);  
  · **William Shakespeare** (“Men Like Ravenous Fishes”, from the eponymous character’s monologue in ***Sir Thomas More***);  
  · **Soundgarden** (“Room a Thousand Years Wide”);  
   · **Janelle Monáe** (“Neon Valley Street”);  
  · **Emperor** (“With Strength I Burn”);  
  · **Enslaved** (“Return to Yggdrasill”);  
  · ***The Wire*** (“Notes on a Criminal Conspiracy”);  
  · **Agalloch** (“In the Shadow of Our Pale Companion”);  
  · **Il Balletto di Bronzo** and **Joanna Newsom** (“Ys”; the title honours both artists’ albums, plus the mythical underwater city after which they’re both named);  
  · **Radiohead** (“How to Disappear Completely”);  
  · **the Wallflowers** (“Another One in the Dark”);  
  · **Arcturus** (“Nightmare Heaven”);  
  · **Lou Reed** (“Kill Your Sons”, though this doubles as a reference to **Doubleaught**’s terminal at the end of “Hang Brain”, which was probably written by **Greg Kirkpatrick**);  
  · **Godspeed You! Black Emperor** (“Motherfucker=Redeemer”);  
  · **Isaac Asimov** (“Star’s End”, a reference to his *Foundation* trilogy; this exact phrase, which I won’t repeat here on account of its being a massive spoiler, is very likely also the inspiration for Bungie’s level “All Roads Lead to Sol…”);  
  · **Tool** (“Eon Blue Apocalypse”);  
  · **Bob Dylan** (“It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding)”);  
  · **Nobuo Uematsu** (the absolutely execrable pun “Dancing MADD”, for which I apologise in advance; it’s got to be worse than Pfhor puns);  
  · ***Star Trek*** (“Errand of Mercy”, which was written by **Gene L. Coon**);  
  · **Jeff Buckley** (“Dream Brother”);  
  · ***Secret of Mana*** (“Thanatos, Beneath the Dust” was partially named in honour of its villain);  
  · **Pavement** (“Transport Is Arranged”);  
  · **Negură Bunget** (“Cel din urmă vis”);  
  · **Cult of Luna and Julie Christmas** (“Letter to the Night”); and  
  · **Krallice** (“Dimensional Bleedthrough”).  

 And I haven’t even touched the net maps. These don’t as consistently follow this rule, but some titles take inspiration from:

  · **Douglas Adams** (“Cathedral of Hate”, “Life Is Wasted on the Living”);  
  · **Thomas Mann** (“Death in Venice”, which I must admit I still haven’t read; I just felt the title was apropos for a net map based on “A Converted Church in Venice, Italy”);  
  · **Rush** (“Cygnus X-1”);  
  · **Blut aus Nord** (“Dialogue with the Stars”);  
  · **Spiritualized** (“Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space”);  
  · **King Crimson** (“Starless and Bible Black”, “Fracture”); and  
  · **Sigh** (“Slaughtergarden Suite”).

inspired a few. I may rename a few others at some point, but I haven’t done nearly as much work on the net maps because I don’t currently have people to test them out with. The level name “Wheeling Hubcap Factory”, meanwhile, originally comes from the Gheritt White terminal in *Marathon* (“Never Burn Money”) and later reappeared throughout *Rubicon*’s dream story, and “Biblical Candy Machines” comes from the *Marathon Infinity* demo (specifically, the “Ne cede malis” terminals).

The appearance of others’ artwork and map designs should not be interpreted as their endorsement of this project; in many cases, I have not specifically contacted them in decades, and in a few cases, I have not yet contacted them at all, though I intend to do so before this scenario gets out of alpha if it is at all possible. (For that matter, references to others’ works should also not be interpreted as their creators’ endorsement of this project, though in many cases they *should* be taken as my endorsements of those creators’ works, if not necessarily of the creators themselves.)

With that caveat aside, I would specifically like to thank **James Hastings-Trew** (*Tempus Irae*), **RyokoTK** (*Starlight X* and *Phoenix*), **D. Scott Brown** (*Rubicon*), and **Chris Lund** (also *Rubicon*) for their permission to use various assets they’ve created. My usage of their assets should not be taken to imply they approve of everything or even anything I’ve written or created, but I’m certainly grateful for their permission to use their assets, which have made *Chronicles* a better game.

I also wish to thank several others for assistance they’ve provided at various stages. **Hamish Sinclair** sent me some of **Doug Zartman**’s unreleased Bob sounds; you can hear them in this project. It’s also quite unlikely this scenario would exist at all without his Story page, and the Vidmasters’ page he co-maintains with **Jim Mitchell** is the main reason I don’t completely suck at this game anymore (additional thanks to anyone whose films appear on the page, particularly **Dr John Sumner**, who has sent me a colossal number of films that aren’t hosted on the Vidmasters’ page).

I don’t believe any of **Dr Mike Trinder**’s assets appear in this scenario these days apart from the airlock in “Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt” and a handful of other levels, but I gained a colossal amount of inspiration from his approach to map design, and while I’m almost certain I no longer have my correspondence with him, I’m also almost certain he gave me specific assistance in solving several mapmaking dilemmas I’d encountered, though I no longer have any recollection of what they were.

Various members at **the Pfhorums** have been immensely helpful at solving problems I’ve encountered, especially **Treellama**, **ravenshining**, and **Wrkncacnter**. **General-RADIX**’s feedback has also affected my approach to some of these levels (especially “Take the Veil”), and she is now contributing utterly amazing artwork, architectural ideas, and story elements that will help to give the scenario a unique flavour. I also wish to thank **Dr John Sumner** twice, first for undoubtedly creating more Vidmaster films than any other *Marathon* player in history, and second for feedback on level difficulty that has helped make *Chronicles* a better balanced game.

It’s unlikely the map design for this scenario would be as good without **Hastur’s Workshop**, a mapmaking page created by **Doubleaught Software** back in the day; I also incorporated **Randall Shaw**’s forcefield idea in at least one level (“Pleiades’ Dust”, which, in fact, uses it twice).

I’d also like to thank everyone whose utilities I employed in the creation of this scenario – especially **Hex!** and **Fux!** by **Bo Levenson** (the latter of these no longer affects the scenario, but it did when it ran in *Infinity*), and **Chisel** by **Kirill Levchenko** and **Dr Mike Trinder**. Aleph One mapmaking tools I’ve used include **Weland**, **Vasara**, **Visual Mode.lua**, **JUICE**, **ShapeFusion**, **PhysicsEditorOne**, and probably a handful of others I’ve already forgotten; I may at some point attempt to compile a list of everyone involved in developing them, though I’m not sure if that’s possible.

Most of my planned story isn’t yet incorporated in these levels, though I would like to note that a bizarre occurence of synchronicity resulted in my original story outline closely mirroring the actual plot of *Rubicon X* in several respects. Because I never released the scenario to the general public in any form until 2008 and didn’t release it to the *Marathon* community at large until 2018, I’m unsure if I’ll continue using my original outline – in particular, I very definitively do not possess the time or the inclination to make enough resources for the branching timelines I originally planned. My original decision to incorporate two timelines was very likely inspired by the ending of **Dr Mike Trinder**’s *Gemini Station*, though I planned this so long ago (most likely still within the twentieth century) that I no longer remember the exact inspiration.

Apologies if I misspelled anyone’s name. I double-checked all the spellings, but I can’t promise that I didn’t misread them. Additional apologies if I omitted credits for anyone who should be here. Contact me and I’ll amend this when I get the opportunity.

The final thanks I wish to give, of course, are to **Bungie** for open-sourcing everything *Marathon*, and for that matter for creating it in the first place, and to everyone who’s ever worked on **Aleph One**.

Lastly, as an aid to people going over the Pfhorums thread/YouTube channel, since several levels have changed names at least once over the course of development, here’s a log of their old names:

· **Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt**: formerly “The Inner Light” and “Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk”;  
· **Pleiades’ Dust**: formerly “Noli pati a scelestis opprimi” and “Illegitimi non carborundum”;  
· **Revisions of the Past**: formerly “Life Seeker”;  
· **Everyone I Went to High School With Is Dead**: formerly “Welcome Home (Sanitarium)” and “Pine View (Hell)”;  
· **Miranda, That Ghost Just Isn’t Holy Anymore**: formerly “Houses of the Holy”;  
· **The Paradox of Tolerance**: formerly “Burn Down the Mission” and “Idioteque”;  
· **Men Like Ravenous Fishes**: formerly “Deadwing” and “Inside Information”;  
· **Room a Thousand Years Wide**: formerly “Tighter & Tighter”;  
· **To Make an Idol of Our Fear and Call It God**: formerly “Please Excuse Our Dust”;  
· **Neon Valley Street**: formerly “2+2=5 (The Lukewarm)”;  
· **Notes on a Criminal Conspiracy**: formerly “Master of Puppets”;  
· **Slaughterhouse-One** through **Slaughterhouse-Five**: formerly “naked lunch one” through “naked lunch five”.

I hope you enjoy this scenario. Comments, suggestions, constructive criticism, praise, offers of employment, submissions of content, pull requests, bug reports, bug fixes, Vid films, etc., are all highly welcome. You can contact me at:

· **the Pfhorums**, where my username is currently The Man: http://pfhorums.com  
· **Fool’s Gold**, where my username is currently Howth Castle and Environs, though it changes at my whim: http://fools-gold.org  
· the **Marathon Discord server**, where I simply use my real name (@ me for fastest response time)  
· or, presumably, here.
