# Marathon-Chronicles-map
Split map files for an in-development Marathon Aleph One scenario

This is where I’m keeping the latest version of the unmerged map for Marathon Chronicles, a scenario I’m building for Marathon Aleph One. It is a sequel to Bungie’s original Marathon trilogy, and it is also additionally intended to flow in the same continuity as several other fan sequels to the original game, most directly Tempus Irae and Rubicon, but also Phoenix and Eternal. It incorporates artwork and, in some cases, architecture from Tempus Irae, Evil, and Rubicon, as well as the original trilogy, though most maps are largely original.

While I hoarded all this content to myself for, in some cases, some twenty-one years, I now intend for the development process of this scenario, like Aleph One itself, to be largely open-source. As a result, anyone who is interested in contributing to or improving the project is welcome to make their own pull requests; if I like them, they will be incorporated into the completed game and you will receive credit.

(The map included in the final link is out of date; you can make your own build of the latest version of the map by merging this folder in Atque. I intend to create a more permanent repository for the game files somewhere else at some point, but I have not done so yet. It will not be practical for me to keep uploading the latest merged map file every time I make a small change, so you will need to merge it yourself if you want the most recent version.)

This project is in a very unfinished state; most game terminals are blank, and there are plenty of glitches, inconsistencies, untextured or misaligned walls, and various other issues to be expected in an in-development game. It should at least be possible to play through and win the entire scenario, however, and hopefully the bonus levels as well (though I haven’t tested those since I added them).
