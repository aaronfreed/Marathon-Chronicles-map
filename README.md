Split map files for an in-development Marathon Aleph One scenario

This is where I’m keeping the latest version of the unmerged map for Marathon Chronicles, a scenario I’m building for Marathon Aleph One. It is a sequel to Bungie’s original Marathon trilogy, and it is also additionally intended to flow in the same continuity as several other fan sequels to the original game, most directly Tempus Irae and Rubicon, but also Phoenix and Eternal. It incorporates artwork and, in some cases, architecture from Tempus Irae, Evil, and Rubicon, as well as the original trilogy, though most maps are largely original.

While I hoarded all this content to myself for, in some cases, some twenty-one years, I now intend for the development process of this scenario, like Aleph One itself, to be largely open-source. As a result, anyone who is interested in contributing to or improving the project is welcome to make their own pull requests; if I like them, they will be incorporated into the completed game and you will receive credit.

(The map included in the final link is out of date; you can make your own build of the latest version of the map by merging this folder in Atque. I intend to create a more permanent repository for the game files somewhere else at some point, but I have not done so yet. It will not be practical for me to keep uploading the latest merged map file every time I make a small change, so you will need to merge it yourself if you want the most recent version.)

This project is in a very unfinished state; most game terminals are blank, and there are plenty of glitches, inconsistencies, untextured or misaligned walls, and various other issues to be expected in an in-development game. It should at least be possible to play through and win the entire scenario, however, and hopefully the bonus levels as well (though I haven’t tested those since I added them).

I haven’t yet compiled a complete list of credits for this scenario. I’m responsible for the bulk of level design; a few other high school friends, who are credited in the scenario images file (click on the Marathon logo when you open the scenario), co-designed a few levels (specifically “Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk”, “Everyone I Went to High School With Is Dead”, “Delusions of Adequacy…”, and the hidden level “Sweet Silence”, plus “Witty Title Not Included” from the net map). I haven’t mentioned them by name because I don’t know if they want their names showing up in search engine results in association with this scenario. If you’re really curious who designed what level, almost all levels have credits in the map writing, including (I’m fairly sure) every level co-designed by others, at least in the solo scenario, apart from “In the Shadow of Our Pale Companion”, which hasn’t even been worked into the story yet.

Other levels are partially adapted from work by Bungie. I haven’t pulled together a complete list of credits for this, but between these and my net maps, I’ve incorporated levels designed by Randy Reddig (“Ne cede malis” for “Biblical Candy Machines”, “Aye Mak Sicur” for “Eon Blue Apocalypse” and “Pfhactory N’Utopia”, “A Converted Church in Venice, Italy” for both “Death in Venice” and “A Converted Net Map in Venice, Italy”, “You Think You’re Big Time? You’re Gonna Die Big Time!” for “Life Is Wasted on the Living”), Greg Kirkpatrick (“Acme Station (Michael Bay Remix)” and co-design of “Son of Grendel” for “How to Disappear Completely”, “Hang Brain” for part of “Kill Your Sons”), Chris Geisel (co-design of “Son of Grendel” for “How to Disappear Completely”), Jason Jones (“Begging for Mercy Makes Me Angry!” for part of “Kill Your Sons”, an in-progress remake of “Kill Your Television” which I will push here when it becomes fun to play), as well as a few other recurring elements from levels designed by multiple creators (most notably, Thoth’s computer banks make an appearance in “Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk”). I’ve also incorporated occasional geometry from others’ scenario for network maps: James Hastings-Trew’s designs for “The Gates of Delirium” (“Slaughtergarden Suite”), “Downward Spiral” (“Cathedral of Hate”), “Brain Damage” (“Lunatic Fringe”) and Chris Lund’s for Rubicon (the original Rozinante design for “Cygnus X-1” and “Breathing Nothing at All”/“Canned Air” for “Fracture”). Finally, RyokoTK has finally given me permission to adapt his level “Monument to All Your Sins” (aka “The Monolith”) for solo combat; a very embryonic form currently appears as “In the Shadow of Our Pale Companion”.

Beyond that, of course, there are levels I’ve simply ripped off. Credit to RyokoTK for “Roquefortress”, which I shamelessly ripped off for “To Make an Idol of Our Fear and Call It God”, and James Hastings-Trew for “Gates of Delirium”, which I shamelessly ripped off for “The Black Angel’s Death Song”. “Black Angel” may reuse a couple of architectural elements of “Gates” outright; for that matter, a couple of segments of “Houses of the Holy” are also fairly similar.

Artwork is trickier. Obviously most of the original assets were Bungie’s; credits should be visible in the scenario already when you click the Marathon logo. I’ve also incorporated work from others’ scenarios. The Tempus Irae textures and scenery, probably 80% of which appear in Chronicles, were mostly designed by James Hastings-Trew, apart from the ones that were adapted outright from Renaissance or Classical artists (mostly Leonardo da Vinci, but occasional others as well). There are also elements from Evil (the staff, the assault rifle, the Devlins) and Rubicon (several monsters, the fusion rifle, the redesigned Magnum, the redesigned rocket launcher). Chris Lund and D. Scott Brown were responsible for the bulk of the latter, while Evil was directed by Randall “Frigid Man” Shaw. Some assets from each of these scenarios were additionally  desgined by others; I don’t know who created what, but Evil credits Chuck Fox, Jesse Freeman, James Head, Colin James, Reddig, and Shaw for artwork; Rubicon credits Lund, Brown, Grant Struthers, Jay Faircloth, and Mayang’s free texture library for artwork; and Tempus Irae credits Hastings-Trew, Chris Boroweic, and Dan Clancy for artwork. I don’t believe I’ve taken artwork from any other scenario, though it is possible that a scattered texture or two from Pfh’Joueur appears; that scenario was created more or less in its entirety by Candace Sheriff (aka Shebob; RIP), who credited Rainier Udelhoven for additional artwork.

Most level titles are taken from songs or albums, with a few others from books or television. Only a handful don’t come from musical or literary sources. For inspiration, *deep breath* credit to Emperor (“Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk”, “With Strength I Burn”), Weakling (“Cut Their Grain and Place Fire Therein”), Panopticon (“Revisions of the Past”, “To Make an Idol of Our Fear and Call It God”), William S. Burroughs (every “Naked Lunch” level), Television (”The Dream’s Dream”), Mr. Bungle (“Everyone I Went to High School With Is Dead”), Led Zeppelin (“Houses of the Holy”), Peter Gabriel (“Here Comes the Flood”), the Velvet Underground (“The Black Angel’s Death Song”), Genesis (“Entangled”, “Supper’s Ready”), Elton John (“Burn Down the Mission”), Porcupine Tree (“Deadwing”), Soundgarden (“Tighter & Tighter”), Radiohead (“2+2=5 (The Lukewarm)”, “How to Disappear Completely”, the old level title “Idioteque” which I abandoned as I felt it didn’t fit the level), Metallica (“Master of Puppets”), the Wallflowers (“Another One in the Dark”), Arcturus (“Nightmare Heaven”), Lou Reed (“Kill Your Sons”, though this title is also partially inspired by Bungie’s terminal at the end of the level, which was probably written by Greg Kirkpatrick), Godspeed You! Black Emperor (“Motherfucker=Redeemer”), Isaac Asimov (“Star’s End”), Tears for Fears (“Famous Last Words”), Tool (“Eon Blue Apocalypse”), Gorguts (“Sweet Silence”, though this level title is also partially inspired by Metallica’s studio in Copenhagen), Bob Dylan (“It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding)”), Nobuo Uematsu (the absolutely execrable pun “Dancing MADD”, for which I apologise in advance; it’s got to be worse than Pfhor puns), Star Trek (“Errand of Mercy”, which was written by Gene L. Coon), Jeff Buckley (“Dream Brother”), Pavement (“Transport Is Arranged”), and Agalloch (“In the Shadow of Our Pale Companion”)… oh, and also the net maps. These don’t as consistently follow this rule, but Douglas Adams (both “Cathedral of Hate” and “Life Is Wasted on the Living”), Thomas Mann (“Death in Venice”, though to be honest I still haven’t read it; I just felt the title was apropos for a netmap), Rush (“Cygnus X-1”), Blut aus Nord (“Dialogue with the Stars”), Spiritualized (“Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space”), King Crimson (“Starless and Bible Black”, “Fracture”), and Sigh (“Slaughtergarden Suite”) inspired a few.

The appearance of others’ artwork and map designs should not be interpreted as their endorsement of this project; in many cases I have not specifically contacted them in decades and in a few cases I have not yet contacted them at all, though I plan to do so before releasing a more complete version of this scenario.

I also wish to thank several others for assistance at various stages. Hamish Sinclair sent me some of Doug Zartman’s previously unreleased Bob sounds; you can hear them in this project. It’s also quite unlikely this scenario would exist at all without his Story page, and the Vidmaster page he co-maintains with Jim Mitchell is a major reason I don’t completely suck at this game anymore (additional thanks to anyone whose films appear on the page). I don’t believe any of Mike Trinder’s assets appear in this scenario apart from the airlock in “Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk” and a handful of other levels these days, but I gained a colossal amount of inspiration from his approach to map design. Various members at the Pfhorums have been immensely helpful at solving problems I’ve encountered, especially Treellama, ravenshining, and W’rkncacnter; General-RADIX’s feedback has also affected my approach to some of these levels. It’s unlikely the map design for this scenario would be as good without Hastur’s Workshop; I also incorporated Randall Shaw’s forcefield idea in a few points. I’d also like to thank everyone whose utilities I employed in the creation of this scenario – especially Hex! and Fux! by Bo Levenson (the latter of these no longer affects the scenario, but it did when it ran in Infinity), and Chisel by Kirill Levchenko and Trinder.

Most of my planned story isn’t yet incorporated in these levels, though I would like to note that a bizarre occurence of synchronicity resulted in my original story outline closely mirroring the actual plot of Rubicon X in several respects. Because I never released the scenario to the general public in any form until 2008 and didn’t release it to the Marathon community at large until 2018, I am unsure if I am going to continue using my original outline – in particular, I very definitively do not possess the time or the inclination to make enough resources to for the branching timelines I originally planned. My original decision to incorporate two timelines was very likely inspired by the ending of Trinder’s Gemini Station, though I planned this so long ago (most likely still within the 20th century) that I no longer remember the exact inspiration.

Finally, of course I would like to thank Bungie for open-sourcing everything Marathon, and everyone who’s ever worked on Aleph One.
