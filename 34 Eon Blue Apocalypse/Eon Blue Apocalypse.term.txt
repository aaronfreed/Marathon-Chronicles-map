thousands are sailing
the same self		the only self

self willed the peril of a thousand fates

a line of infinite ends		finite finishing
the one remains oblique and pure

arching to the single point of consciousness

$C2The $Itrih xeem$i broke against my dying vessel and smashed a fine patina across the mystery shields of this station. My crew battled the aliens during the blast, and the silence which came after was sullen and deafening--the pure silence of victory.

But the trackless whisper chattering through the hollow space in these cursed walls buzzes and threatens madness. The abomination cracked the shells of my crew and sucked the husks, tossing them unseen and shattering the spindle like a dried creche.

The shields are gone, not down, but gone; and so are the engineers. It’s coming back, I’m sure; and my last mercy is immolation.

Great Mother crouched behind the Throne, I make this wrong right.

There will come soft rains and the smell of
   the ground,
And swallows circling with their shimmering
   sound,

And frogs in the pools singing at night,
And wild plum-trees in tremulous white;

Robins will wear their feathers fire,
Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;

And not one will know of the war, not one
Will care at last when it is done.

Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree
If Mankind perished utterly;

And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,
Would scarcely know that we were gone.
