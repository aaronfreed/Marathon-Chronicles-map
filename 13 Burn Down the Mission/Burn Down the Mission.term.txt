You’re going to have to take a dip in that infamous Pfhor slime to continue with your mission. Yes, everyone’s favorite task. 

I will teleport in a recharge can at this location in case you haven’t enough energy to make it through. Your entrance point should be obvious enough. You should swim to the right until you see what looks like an exit.

$C0...here and smash the switches to trigger this ship’s automated destruct sequence.

Be patient. You’ll probably have to make some clever jumps to get through. I’m sorry I can’t give you any help, but I’m working on destroying the Pfhor fleet’s gravity controller right now. I imagine it will be incredibly handy during your next mission.

$C0How fortunate for you –– the Pfhor were expecting you. You’re going to have to take a sojourn through the Pfhor living quarters if you wish to gain access to the rest of this ship. I believe there will be some way to override what they’ve just done. There should be an entrance to their quarters shortly after this terminal.

Keep moving, and I’ll see you soon.
