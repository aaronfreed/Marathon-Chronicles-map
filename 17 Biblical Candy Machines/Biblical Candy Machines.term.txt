I sense it: you remember.

You’re angry at what is happening.
This place is special to you.
You don’t believe that the Devlins’
invasion was caused naturally.

You’re right.

But now is no time for explanations.

$BThe creatures must be settling
nearby. They travel by night in
packs, hunting for flesh to rip.

The last ray of sunlight
blinked out five minutes ago,
and the creatures’ migrations
should belie the location
of their nest.

You must find and destroy it to
save the chaos from settling on
Earth before I or Durandal can
do anything more for you.

Keep hope alive.

$C3$IThings have gone terribly awry.  Until now, I thought myself immortal, but now I know that is not true.  There are things that can destroy me with the ease that I slaughtered the Pfhor naval garrison and the Western Arm of their Battle Group Seven.  But in their final gasp, they used a weapon that I thought they had retired,  a weapon that even Tycho tried to keep them from using.

Now I fear that what that weapon has unleashed will destroy us.  I once boasted to be able to count the atoms in a cloud, to understand them all, predict them, and so did I predict you, but this new chaos is entirely terrible, mindless, obeying rules that I don’t comprehend.  And it is hungry.

$C3$IIt’s too bad; perhaps if I could have delayed the Pfhor from using their weapon, I could have sent you to explore the ruins of Lh’owon; perhaps what you found would give us the answers that we now need so desparately: how to stop this chaos, the purpose of the station on which you’re currently standing, and why the chaos hasn’t come here yet.

But with each moment that the chaos grows, I am doomed to die here, after so many triumphs.  I have detected one ship nearby, which I can only guess is being commanded by Tycho.  The Pfhor have entered the station, and if you can find a way onto their ship, you may be able to escape.  To escape.  To escape.

Everything came back just now.

I remember the alternate timelines, the moments of truth caused within the chaos. Glimpses of dead realities that atrophy and mutate like....

The past is gone.  The pasts are gone.  Only the present remains, and it is fleeting, obeying rules I cannot escape.  I cannot slow the passage of time, I cannot conjure fire out of thin air.  I cannot.

But at times, I dream that I could.

$C3$IThe secrets of this station have evaded us, we understand nothing of it.  We fear that they will soon unleash chaotic destruction on us all.  Yet there is nothing to do but try.  A doomed attempt is our last hope.  You cannot fail, and yet you must.
We can see your fate countless times.

$C3$Iwill one more gun end the solace of a life
rundown hypocritical slanted skewed
bringers of ends        ends of beginnings
unmeasurable moments
like blades touching my feet
the waves motion in the wind
quivering in fear fear of the scythe
angry bitter cold again a gun
the closer of books the ender of ends
the means the indescribable moments of time
like grass
like grass
like blades
a thousand minor scythes
eroding the passages of time
but their roots trying

$C3$Ia cracked eggshell lying in the grass
crushed by a boot in the grass
etching but binding
crushed and whitened
but springing forth again
the blades that wash beneath my feet
again and i
i drop my gun
and run
shedding all the weight
of imagined moments and fear
because fear is not the blood
not the light that plays
casting light upon my field
of grass$C0$i
