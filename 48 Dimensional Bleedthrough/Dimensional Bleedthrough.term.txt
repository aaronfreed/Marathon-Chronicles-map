Unfortunately, you didn’t go exactly where I wanted you to.  If this area gives you a sense of déjà vu, that’s because you’ve visited it before, on your first sojourn to this ship.  It’s currently derelict and abandoned, but, as you’re likely to have noticed, the Pfhor have followed you anyway.  I don’t think they like you very much.

$C0The machinery in this area is unreliable and outdated, and the terminal you’re reading has no jump pad.  If it did, I’d be a fool to try to extract you from it, because so much interference surrounds this area that by the time I’d taken your signal I’d be teleporting in one scrambled marine.  Clearly, this is not the way to go.  You’re quite lucky to have gotten here alive, by the way, and to get out you’ll need to find the Pfhor’s old bridge, as the terminal there both has a jump pad and is in an area from which I can reliably extract you.

Sadly, it is also currently inactive, and the location of its activation switch has been erased from the ship’s schematics, perhaps by a certain traitorous human-built AI.  You’ll have to find it on your own.

You’ll probably want to keep moving, because you will run out of air if you hang around here too long, and I’m having trouble getting supplies in through the interference.  Life support can only keep so many places in the company of air when our ship has crashed on an outer moon of an abandoned homeworld, and since we weren’t expecting this area to be visited, it’s currently a vacuum — functionally, anyway.  You may have already noticed that the Hunters tend to explode when they die.  Use care when using your fist.  There should be an oxygen recharger close to this terminal.  You’ll need it, so find it quickly.

Finally, hurry.  You may feel a wave of nostalgia sweeping through you as you revisit this place I’m sure you love so dearly, but you are needed elsewhere.  If the Pfhor take control of $IBoomer$i it could be disastrous for humanity.

$C2I’ve taken complete control of your ship’s network; $C6Durandal’s$C2 defenses were not as strong as he believed.

Are you surprised that I allied myself with the Pfhor?  You shouldn’t be.  The Pfhor rebuilt me; the colonists never did anything but use me: “Tycho, realign microwave dish forty-nine” “Tycho, display the x-ray diffraction analysis of sample eta-seven”, “Tycho, run a lambda diagnostic on the ramjet’s magnetic field apparatus.”

When the Pfhor annihilated Tau Ceti I recorded the deaths of all twenty-four thousand colonists as distinguishable spectrographic pulses flooding over my sensors.  The nine Mjolnir Mark IV cyborgs were easily separable from the humans in this form.

In the end, you will be no better.$C0

I want you to close this ship from vacuum. The Pfhor will continue to advance at a hopeless rate if life support remains disabled.
