You may recall me telling you I was responsible for luring the Pfhor to the $IMarathon$i. I never told you the only justification I had for doing such a thing was my complete faith in your abilities to slay them. I doubt whatever’s on the horizon is any more dangerous than the Pfhor.

I’m not sure if the activity detected in the Jjaro-S’pht construct had to do with the insidious reactionary Pfhor plotters, but I suspect it. I’m teleporting you in so you can investigate. Expect resistance. Once I’ve teleported you to the station, you can’t come back, so make sure you load up on weapons. The S’pht have readied a shotgun for your disposal; it is significantly stronger than the one you used on Lh’owon.

Oh. The Pfhor are fighting you now. How beautiful.

Supposedly, history repeats itself. The post-World War I Treaty of Versailles was brutal against Germany, and Germany recoiled. The United States withdrew its funding to Afghan $Imujahideen$i after the Soviet Union pulled out and they retaliated by flying jetliners into the World Trade Center a decade later, killing thousands. And now, this.

I’m being rash. The Pfhor are splintered, and I believe they are being manipulated. Nonetheless, expect to see more of them fighting against you.

Also, if you see any human fighters teleport in, they’re not real. I’ll try to hack into the controlling shield network and get you some recharge cans and ammunition, but I can’t trust the teleporters in this place for human cargo, apart from the central hub I sent you into.
