#$bduality: Chad_ @ydnar
***  #$bduality :End of /NAMES list.
***  Mode is +stn
     ydnar: Bueno.
     Chad_: No prob. Greg kept pinging out.
     ydnar: ::nod:: Keeps MacIRC open most
            of the day, but runs stuff that
            kills the connection.
     Chad_: Oh yeah, I was meaning to ask.
            What does Eight Nineteen [the
            secret level] mean?
     ydnar: HS doesn’t know already?
     Chad_: I don’t know. I was curious
            myself, I didn’t ask.
     ydnar: That’s all I’m going to say. :)
     Chad_: C’mon, throw me a bone :)
     ydnar: I did. A big fat clue.
            Chad_ deep in thought
     ydnar: Who would I tip my hat to with
            such a fiendish easter egg?
     Chad_: Bungie?
     ydnar: pshaw
     Chad_: Where’s Hamish when I need him!
     ydnar: You’re thinking too hard. :)
     Chad_: Could it be a date? August 19?
     ydnar: Hamish knows, I think. He has
            to. He just hasn’t let on yet.
     Chad_: I don’t think so. He trusts me,
            and is pretty straight up. He
            trusted me with your picture.
     ydnar: Heh. Why would I go out the
            trouble to spell the numbers?
     Chad_: Anagram?
     ydnar: What are the numbers?
     Chad_: 819
     ydnar: Yeah. I could’ve written “Hats
            Off to 819” but I didn’t.
     Chad_: What am I missing? (It’s easy
            ’cause you know it.) ;)
     ydnar: That could be interpreted any
            number of ways. 8-19, 81-9...
     Chad_: Does this have something you’ve
            previously told the player in
            Infinity?
     ydnar: The title has nothing to do
            with the plot.
     Chad_: So it’s totally independent of
            Marathon? Haven’t you used 819
            before?
     ydnar: Eight and nineteen each stand
            for something. Not independent
            of Marathon, just of the plot.
     Chad_: Eight for double aught ,,,
            sideways..
     ydnar: Don’t think so hard.
     Chad_: But you spelled it out.
     ydnar: It’s not that complicated.
     Chad_: I’m making this harder than it
            is, huh?
     ydnar: Yup. I’m really surprised no
            one’s gotten it yet.
     Chad_: I’ve heard other people talking
            about it. I don’t think anyone
            knows.
     ydnar: Well, I’m checking the “What’s
            in a Name?” page.
     Chad_: Do upper and lower case have
            anything to do with it?
     ydnar: No, tho 819 should be uppercase
     Chad_: All uppercase?
     ydnar: Yeah, but you can’t make
            numbers uppercase.
     Chad_: Type it out how you had it in
            the level.
     ydnar: Hats Off to Eight Nineteen
     Chad_: Is it something everyone should
            know or an obscure reference?
     ydnar: The former.
     Chad_: HOEN.
     ydnar: You’re pretty close.
     Chad_: No T, right?
     ydnar: No OEN either. Just an H. But
            that H doesn’t come from Hats.
     Chad_: Am I hot or cold?
     ydnar: You’re warm.
     Chad_: There’s only one other H, in
            eight.
     ydnar: Correct.
     Chad_: Is that relevant?
     ydnar: It’s very relevant. how else
            can you get H out of Eight?
     ydnar: I’ll bbias. gotta get some
            breakfast.
     Chad_: OK, I’ll be pondering...
     Chad_: This is going to be one of
            those things I kick myself for

     Chad_: You back?
     ydnar: Yah
     Chad_: Yeah well I got no hair left.
     Chad_: Pulled the shit out
     Chad_: There’s little pieces of paper
            all around my office with eight
            nineteen on it
     ydnar: Heh
     ydnar: No letters?
     Chad_: Not yet... I’ve gone through
            everything I can think of. The
            only thing is I don’t know the
            original reference. You
            mentioned letters. I assume
            you’re talking about specific
            ones in a certain order, right?
     ydnar: Yep.
***  Godot (hsinclir@smd022.smd.tcd.ie) has joined channel #$bduality
     Chad_: Welcome.
     Godot: What is this place?
     ydnar: the place that will be on
            everyone’s lips.
     Chad_: Hey, I only told Hamish.
     Godot: Greetings Randy & Chad. Oddly,
            this is familar to me, as if it
            were were from an old dream…
     ydnar: I’m shocked, honestly.
     Chad_: Good shock or bad shock?
     Godot: I have arrived and it will
            never be the same again ;-)
     Chad_: We were talking about letters.
            Certain letters, especially H.
            What’s so special about H?
     Godot: H is for Hamish
     ydnar: ::chuckle::
     Chad_: That’s it, you named it after
            Hamish
     Godot: I doubt it
            Chad_ looking confused
     ydnar: hehe
     ydnar: Unless I totally screwed up...
     ydnar: What’s nineteen?
     Godot: Now that’s a thought
     Chad_: Elaborate, ydnar
     Godot: Nineteen the average age of
            Vietnam US troops
     ydnar: Heh
     Chad_: But it’s got something to do
            with Marathon
     ydnar: Well, someone in this room is
            19, but that has nothing to do
            with it.
     Godot: You know what you wouldn’t get
            much work done with IRC around
     Chad_: 1+9=10
     ydnar: never seen you on irc before,
            hamish.
     Godot: Never been on before...
     ydnar: ::nod:: What’s this I hear
            about you giving out pictures?
     Godot: Pictures? What pictures? Never
            seen any… Don’t know nuthin…
            You should check your server at
            odsnet though… Cobwebs
     ydnar: Lots of cobwebs.
     Chad_: I found it at
               www.elvis.is.dead.com
     ydnar: How many letters are there in
            the english alphabet? hehe
     Chad_: 26
     Godot: The US or the UK?
     ydnar: ::shrug::
     Chad_: HS. They’re letters. Right?
     ydnar: :)
     Chad_: Did you really name it after
            Hamish? Or coincidence?
     ydnar: Do you have any idea how much
            trouble it was to even make
            that easter egg? coincidence 
            had nothing to do with it. <g>
     Chad_: Yeah, but the letters HS stand
            for something. Hats off to
            Hamish Sinclair?
