$IOld Henry went past the pet shop which was never open, into the park which was never closed, and the park was full of a very smooth, clean, green grass. So Henry took off all his clothes and began rubbing his flesh into the wet, clean, green grass. He accompanied himself with a little tune.

Beneath the ground the dirty brown writhing things called worms interpreted the pitter patter from above as rainfall. Rainfall in worm world means two things, mating and bath time. Both of these experiences were thouroughly enjoyable to the worm colony. Within seconds the entire surface of the park was a mass of dirty, brown, soggy, writhing forms. He was still pleased, old Michael and he began whistling a tune this time to accompany himself.

Jerusalem Boogie to us perhaps, but to the birds it meant that supper was ready.$i

And he’s crying with a loud voice,

$C1The Guaranteed Eternal Sanctuary Man

The lovers come across a town dominated by two characters: one a benevolent farmer, and the other the head of a highly disciplined scientific religion. The latter likes to be known as “The Guaranteed Eternal Sanctuary Man” and claims to contain a secret new ingredient capable of fighting fire. This is a falsehood, an untruth, a whopper and a taradiddle, or to put it in clearer terms; a lie.$i

can’t you see he’s fooled you all?

look into my mouth he cried
and all your children cross down many paths
I bet my life he’ll walk inside

with a spoonful of miracle
the Guaranteed Eternal Sanctuary...
