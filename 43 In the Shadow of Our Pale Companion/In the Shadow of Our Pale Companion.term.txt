If you look just to your north, you’ll see a small part of the S’pht Citadel of Antiquity.  This ancient Citadel was the site of the conclusive battle in the short war between the S’pht and the Pfhor.  The primary tower is inaccessible by direct teleportation, evidently because some of the Citadel’s defenses are still functional.  I need you to find a way in. I don’t have all the details as to how you can get in, but I know there is a teleporter directly below the surface of the Citadel that will take you directly into the structure.  Unfortunately, it’s currently sealed off, and you won’t be able to unseal it by mucking about in the water here.  I suspect the controls to open it up are well above you.
#PICT 1602
You should exercise caution in climbing to the surface, as the Pfhor are unlikely to take the intrusion kindly.  You probably won’t receive another attack here, so you’ll want to use the pattern buffer as soon as possible, but as you progress, you’ll receive a merciless onslaught, and I can’t spare too many of my humans or S’pht to assist you.  The Pfhor don’t know what secrets the Citadel contains, but they suspect that whatever it houses won’t beneficial to their empire, and thus they have little desire to allow these secrets to seep out to humanity or their S’pht.  They’d just as soon destroy the structure entirely, but it has stood roughly intact for some two thousand years, and I doubt any item in the Pfhor arsenal short of the $Itrih xeem$i can destroy it.
#PICT 1602
So get to climbing; the sooner we expose its secrets, the better.  I’ll keep you supplied with a steady stream of toys when possible; you’re going to meet a sizable welcoming party.  Should you need a shield recharge, you are best advised to return to the lighted area directly below this waterfall, or to a similar area in the north sector of this compound.  I can’t provide them instantly, but I’ll try to keep you from needing to wait too long.

Good luck.

If you insist on stumbling around when our time here is limited, I may just decide that you’re not all that special after all and teleport you out into space.

With the imminent arrival of the Pfhor fleet, the humans and my S’pht have begun enhancing the defenses of their headquarters.  Even if I have to abandon them, they will be able to hold out for a long time.

I am going to teleport you to the higher levels of the Citadel.  Hopefully, we can find some useful information at the top.  We must determine what happened to the eleventh S’pht clan.

We’re going to have visitors soon.  The Western Arm of Pfhor Battle Group Seven is en-route and should be here in about twenty hours.  

Battle Group Seven represents over ten percent of active Pfhor naval strength.  I doubt whether even I can hold them back with a single ship, but I will try.

Stop messing around.  Didn’t I tell you that a significant portion of the strongest nearby galactic navy is headed in this direction?
